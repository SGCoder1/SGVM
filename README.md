# SGVM
In the long form "SG Virtual Machines" is a custom virtual machine.
It contains its own file extensions for disc images and VHDs.
More information can be found by installing the software.

# Installation
This software is Windows-specific (or I think at least) and requires the 
.NET 8 runtime to be installed first. To install, navigate to the latest 
version by doing so [here](https://github.com/SGCoder1/SGVM/releases/tag/v0.1.0), download and run the installer.
